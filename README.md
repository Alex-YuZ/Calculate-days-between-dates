## Introduction
This repo is only an example for the purpose of demonstrating how to solve problems in programming. This exercise is from Data Structure and Algorithm Course from Udacity.

This course introduces some fundamental and essential principles to follow to better solve a problem, e.g.

0. **Donâ€™t panic!**
1. What are the inputs?
2. What are the outputs?
3. Work through some examples by hand.
4. Simple mechanical solution
5. Develop incrementally and test as we go.

There are many different ways to solve a problem. But the key points includes how to break a realistic and complicate one into pieces. And combine them logically and serve for you whole purpose. The most important and worthwhile takeaways I get from this lesson is:
- Logic
- Completeness
- Moderation
- Trial and test
